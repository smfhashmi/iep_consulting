Understanding and advocating for your child's educational rights is crucial in ensuring they receive the proper support in school. A 504 Plan is designed to provide accommodations for students with disabilities so they can have equal access to learning, regardless of their challenges. These accommodations may include changes to the classroom environment, extended testing time, or specific behavioral interventions.

At IEP Consulting BCBA Inc., we help parents navigate the 504 process from start to finish. We collaborate with school teams to ensure your child’s unique needs are identified and addressed. Our team is experienced in interpreting evaluation results, determining eligibility, and ensuring that the accommodations listed in the 504 Plan are practical and beneficial.

### Parental Rights in the 504 Process

As a parent, you play a central role in the development and implementation of your child's 504 Plan. You have the right to:
Request an evaluation if you believe your child may qualify for accommodations.
Participate in meetings to discuss and review your child’s needs and progress.
Disagree with school decisions and seek mediation or due process if necessary.
We are here to help you understand these rights and advocate for your child, ensuring the plan created addresses their educational and behavioral needs effectively. Our goal is to ensure that you and your child have a strong voice in the decision-making process, fostering an inclusive and supportive learning environment.
