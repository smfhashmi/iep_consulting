At  IEP consulting BCBA Inc., we specialize in supporting children with special education needs by offering expert IEP consulting services. Navigating the world of special education can be complex, but we are here to help families ensure their child receives the appropriate support and accommodations necessary for success in school.

### How We Help with Special Education:

Developing Tailored IEPs: We work with parents, schools, and therapists to create individualized education plans (IEPs) that address each child’s unique learning, behavioral, and developmental needs.

Advocacy and Support: We advocate for your child’s rights during school meetings and ensure that their IEP includes the appropriate goals, services, and accommodations.

Expert Alignment with ABA: As certified BCBA consultants, we integrate evidence-based Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) strategies into the IEP to help children develop crucial life skills, manage behaviors, and succeed academically.

Our mission at IEP consulting BCBA Inc. is to ensure that children with special needs receive personalized, comprehensive support to thrive in both school and daily life. We empower parents and collaborate with educators to create the best educational environment for every child.
