Speech and verbal behavior development are crucial aspects of a child's overall communication skills. At IEP consulting BCBA Inc., we focus on helping children enhance their ability to communicate effectively through targeted interventions. Using principles from Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA), we work on increasing language skills, improving articulation, and fostering meaningful verbal interactions.
Our approach to verbal behavior development emphasizes:

Mand Training: Teaching children to make requests, helping them communicate their needs and wants.
Tact Training: Expanding vocabulary by labeling and describing objects, actions, and environments.

Intraverbal Training: Encouraging conversation and social dialogue by teaching children to respond to questions and engage in meaningful exchanges.

By focusing on these areas, we help children improve their speech, increase their ability to express thoughts and feelings, and build stronger social connections. At BCBA Inc., we are dedicated to fostering each childâ€™s verbal potential, ensuring they have the tools to communicate confidently and effectively.
