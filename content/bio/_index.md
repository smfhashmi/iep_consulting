  aboutYou: "I was born in Transylvania, Romania. At an early age, I developed an
    interest in psychology and helping others. In 2006 I graduated from
    Babes-Bolyai State University in Romania with a B.S. in Clinical Psychology.
    I then obtained a master’s degree in communications and human resources at
    David Ogilvy University in Bucharest. In California, I graduated from the
    Chicago School of Professional Psychology with an M.A. in Clinical
    Psychology with an emphasis in Applied Behavior Analysis and conducted
    research on Joint Control with Dr. Joyce Tu-BCBA-D. Dr Joyce was trained by
    B.F. Skinner&#39;s daughter, Dr. Julie Vargas. I enjoyed working under her
    wing for several years post-graduation. Over the course of the years, I
    devoted time working in academia and subsequently in a Child and Adolescent
    University Hospital where I first helped individuals with ASD in 2004. I
    studied Verbal Behavior under a reputable Professor and mentor, Dr. Hank
    Schlinger, PhD, BCBA-D at Chicago School of Professional Psychology, Los
    Angeles. While serving as a Behavior Consultant and Clinical Director at
    various agencies in CA I learned the importance of verbal behavior
    programming in early intervention for children with ASD and related
    disorders. In 2012 I volunteered and worked at City of Hope Medical Center,
    CA and helped families and children in their pediatric unit. It was a
    fulfilling experience where I used many of the qualities that I believe are
    crucial for a behavior analyst: empathy, advocacy, objectivity and
    professionalism. Performed multidisciplinary evaluations of school age
    students with autism.  I worked in multi-disciplinary evaluations including
    the use of the following: Systematic Observations, Interviews, Rating
    Scales, Intelligence Tests, Achievement Tests, Curriculum-Based Assessments,
    &amp; Review of Records. Conducted Functional Behavioral Assessments and
    collaborated with teachers in the creation of Behavior Intervention Plans,
    Self-Monitoring Systems/Self &amp; Match Systems. Progress monitored &amp;
    graphed data. Assisted in the transition and referral process as students
    with autism entered or exited IU programs.  Collaborated with teachers in
    goal setting and participated in IEP meetings for students in grades K-12. 
    Participated in screening and interviews for instructional assistants.
    Facilitated training for teachers, behavior analysts, instructional
    assistants, and transportation staff. I have a solid knowledge of the
    healthcare industry and providers including Medi-Cal, Medicare, healthy
    family benefits and services, and commercial marketplaces for several
    states.  I am currently a Ph.D. student and working towards my licensure in
    clinical psychology in Ca, NC and VA. In 2015 I formed an agency to serve
    high functioning individuals with autism in California. In my free time, I
    love to play tennis and travel. I am a mother and a dog lover."
